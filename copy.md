## **Brokered Access: Where Ransomware Attacks Begin**

Access brokers arm ransomware gangs and other threat actors with everything they need to strike.

How it works:

- Compromise companies through phishing, CVE exploitation, infostealers, or brute force.
- Stay hidden while mapping systems and identifying high-value targets.
- Sell that access directly to ransomware affiliates in private, one-on-one chats—far from public forums.

In 2024, over 8,500 U.S. victims were compromised by access brokers—resulting in more than 2,800 confirmed data theft and operational disruption events.

# Intercepting Attacks at Every Stage in the Kill Chain

Ransomware attacks don’t start with encryption—they start with stolen access. We cut off attacks before they lead to data theft, disruption, or financial loss.

‍

We act at every stage in the kill chain—whether it’s initial access, lateral movement, or just before encryption.

‍

While traditional defenses offer a single layer of defense, we disrupt deals wherever the opportunity presents itself—shutting down threats before they lead to data theft or business interruption.

## How it works

From Detection to Disruption in 7 Steps

### Upload Your Domains and Vendor Domains

You share your key domains, IP ranges, and critical vendor domains. We take it from there.

### We Engage

We actively engage hundreds of access brokers and criminal insiders in private to identify real-time compromises and insider sales—before attackers act on them.

### **We Detect**

We detect credible compromises tied to your domains or vendor domains, flagged through exclusive visibility from our undercover communications.

### **We Investigate**

Our team verifies each threat actor’s claim using OSINT, technical indicators, underground reputation, and past victim feedback to confirm validity and assess risk.

### **We Intercept**

We engage threat actors directly to intercept access sales and insider deals—cutting off attacks before they escalate to data theft or encryption.

### **We Alert**

Attack intercepted. Now’s your window to remediate and lock out future threats.

### **We Investigate Further**

Post-incident, we assist with deeper investigation—tracing root cause, mapping vendor risk, and supporting law enforcement engagement when needed.
